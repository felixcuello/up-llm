# Universidad de Palermo - LLMs Investigation

Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea of this repository is to:

1. Investigate what tools are related to LLMs that could be useful for us
2. Gather links to papers, articles, blog posts, etc. that could be useful for us
3. Create code snippets that could be useful for us
4. Create a list of questions that we have and that we need to answer / TODO list

- [ ] Get access to the University Cluster
    - [ ] Understand which models can be ran in the cluster (knowing that only some can be ran distributely with Spark
      or with GPUs)
    - [ ] Understand how to use the university cluster
    - [ ] Understand how to train a model in the cluster
        - [ ] Understand how to use GPUs in the cluster
        - [ ] Understand how to use Spark in the cluster

- [ ] Downloading a tiny deepseek model and made it to work locally
    - [ ] find the deepseek link
    - [ ] download the model
    - [ ] run the model
    - [ ] understand the model
    - [ ] check if we can do the same at the university model
